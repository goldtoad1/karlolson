### Cyber Resources/ Open Source Training & Events:

1. [link](https://ctftime.org/) - List of CTF competitions. Check Archive/Writeups and then go to competition and do the attacks. Note, some competitions close servers, some stay up. You will have to search to find ones that you can still register/do, but the writeups are great. This is the ‘Official’ CTF competition ranking site and list of competitions worldwide. Best thing to do is register, compete (don’t worry if you don’t even get one right), then read the writeups after competitions and retry. 

2. [link](https://www.captf.com/practice-ctf/) - Great list of free always on hackable websites/challenges/etc. Practice!

3. [link](https://www.offensive-security.com/) - OK, we are all broke and money is tight. When you get the chance, this course costs ~$1k. It is the best course I have ever taken. You are given access to a corporate network of 50+ systems/servers as a lab, the course teaches you A LOT about linux, scripting, pen-testing, etc. Then the test is a 48 hour pentest of a corporate network w/ full report write-up. Highly respected certification in pen-test arena’s and worth the price of admission (this is only cert/company I will say that about). Gives you 90 days lab access. Note: Plan to spend about 2-3 hours/day for the 90 days to complete this successfully.

4. [link](https://365.csaw.io/register) - Great CTF practice environment.
There are tons of other sites/trainings/etc out there. The above is usually my go-to sites. A quick google and you will find more. This stuff can be addictive and fun. If you find you really enjoy these things, recommend joining the CU Cyber team (finer details to follow).
